## Comparation Tables for Inner and Right Join.
### LEFT JOIN ve RIGHT JOIN FarklarÄ±
| Feature             | LEFT JOIN                                                                 | RIGHT JOIN                                                                 |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **What it Includes?** | Includes **all** rows from the left table (the first table after FROM) and matching rows from the right table. | Includes **all** rows from the right table (the table after JOIN) and matching rows from the left table. |
| **Focus** | Focuses on the left table. All rows from the left table are guaranteed to be in the result set. | Focuses on the right table. All rows from the right table are guaranteed to be in the result set. |
| **Non-matching Rows** | Non-matching rows from the left table are included in the result set. Values for columns from the right side will be `NULL`. | Non-matching rows from the right table are included in the result set. Values for columns from the left side will be `NULL`. |
| **Alternative Syntax** | Can also be written as `LEFT OUTER JOIN`.                                  | Can also be written as `RIGHT OUTER JOIN`.                                 |
| **Symmetry** | A `RIGHT JOIN` query can be written as a `LEFT JOIN` by swapping the left and right tables. | A `LEFT JOIN` query can be written as a `RIGHT JOIN` by swapping the left and right tables. |

## UNION ALL:
Important Note: SELECT queries combined with UNION ALL must have:
   - The same number of columns,
   - Corresponding columns with compatible data types. (varchar - varchar column or if column includes string - string value )
